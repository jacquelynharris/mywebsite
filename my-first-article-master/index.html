                <!-- add your article text here inside p tags --><p class="copy">The Justice Leadership USA headquarters in Harlem have the sleek, bright look of a start-up. One of the front desks is neatly piled with informational sheets on how to close Rikers Island and posters promoting the upcoming City Council Uniform Land Use Review Procedure (ULURP) public hearing.</p>
                <p class="copy">The New York City Council will be holding the hearing on September 5th to hear public opinion on the proposal to begin building four borough-based jails. According to the Mayor’s office, the jails will replace and ultimately close Rikers Island.The ULURP process is usually to review details like the size, height, and use of city building proposals, but this particular process includes all four jail applications in one proposal.</p>
                <p class="copy">Mayor de Blasio’s administration proposal to open the borough jails as a replacement to Rikers aims to “create a correctional system with a smaller jail population, safer facilities, and fairer culture inside.” As part of the plan, the Mayor’s office proposed to shrink the NYC jail population from 9,400, the 2017 NYC daily jail population, to 5,000 and then introduce that population into a jail placed near the borough courthouse where their case would be heard in.</p>
                <p class="copy">Justice Leadership USA, is dedicated to decarcerating New York, and is preparing for the hearing with it’s #CloseRikers campaign. The campaign, run by advocates and formerly incarcerated people at Riker’s, supports the proposal to introduce borough based jails as a replacement to Riker’s, and are trying to remind community members what the bureaucratic review process is for.</p>
                <p class="copy">“When we go through these ULURPs... people forget it’s really about the people,” says Tamika Graham, a campaign leader for #CLOSErikers and Director of Canvassing, who was formerly incarcerated in Rikers. “ If you haven’t been there you really can’t speak on it. We need to make sure our voices are at the forefront.”</p>
                <p class="copy">Benjamin Ndugga-Kabuye, a Research and Advocacy Manager at Black Alliance for Just Immigration is a volunteer for No New Jails, a group that rejects the borough jail proposal. Ndugga-Kabuye rejects the idea that the building of the new jails will lead to closing Rikers. </p>
                 <p class="copy">“The ULURP is about building jails, but the plan It’s not based on a legal document. It’s a “jail plan,” says Ndugga-Kabuye. He believes that since most of the incarcerated people at Riker’s have not been charged, city efforts in facilitating bail, fighting remands, and investing in communities are the solutions to mass incarceration in New York.“The need is urgent, but there is no urgency from the city.”</p>
